# Nextcloud App Store

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nextcloud/appstore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nextcloud/appstore)

## Dependencies

* Python >= 3.4

## Development Installation
If you want to get a quick running development setup, you can use a predefined make command to automatically set up a virtual environment and install the web app with sqlite as database. **Do not set up production using this command!**

First make sure that you've got **venv** installed. You can check for it by running:

    python3 -m venv -h

If you get a **No module named venv** error, you need to install it first. Some distributions like Ubuntu require you to install it separately, e.g.:

    sudo apt-get install python3-venv

Then run:

    make dev-setup

This will automatically set up an admin user with name **admin** and password **admin**.

The server can be started after activating the virtual environment first:

    source venv/bin/activate
    python manage.py runserver

The website is available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000). Code changes will auto reload the server so happy developing!

You can skip the **Installation** chapter.

## Installation

To get started, change into your destination folder and clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/appstore.git

Then change into the directory:

    cd appstore

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)

Instead of installing all Python libraries globally, it is recommended to use [pyvenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to keep things locally. That way you can make sure to not interfere with other things.

The package is included in Python 3.3 or later but some distributions split out certain parts from the default distribution and require you to install them manually. On Ubuntu for instance you would need to install the following package first:

    sudo apt-get install python3-venv

Afterwards set up a new virtual environment by running the following command:

    pyvenv venv

This will create a local virtual environment in the **venv** folder. You only need to do this once in the beginning.

Then activate it:

    source venv/bin/activate

**Note**: The above command changes your shell settings for the current session only, so once you launch a new terminal you need to run the command again to register all the paths.

**Note**: Keep in mind that you need to have the virtual environment activated for all the following commands

### Installing Required Libraries

Next install the required libraries. By default pip (the package manager) is shipped by default, however certain distributions split it out into a separate repository. On Ubuntu for instance you would need to install the following package first:

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip

If you used a virtual environment the libraries will be installed locally, otherwise pip tries to install them globally so you might need to add sudo before the next command:

    pip3 install -r requirements/base.txt

If you are running a development setup, you should also install the development libs

    pip3 install -r requirements/development.txt

### Adjusting Default Settings
To get your instance running in development or in production you need to create your local settings file in **nextcloudappstore/local_settings.py** which overwrites and enhances the settings defined in **nextcloudappstore/local_settings.py**. The local settings file is excluded from version control.

For development paste in the following file contents:
```python
DEBUG = True

# generate the SECRET_KEY by yourself for instance by using the following command:
# env LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc "a-zA-Z0-9-_\$\?" < /dev/urandom | head -c 64; echo
SECRET_KEY = 'change this!'
```

For more settings, check the [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/settings/)

**Note**: Absolutely make sure to generate a new **SECRET_KEY** value! Use the following command for instance to generate a token:

    env LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc "a-zA-Z0-9-_\$\?" < /dev/urandom | head -c 64; echo

### Creating The Database Schema
After all settings are adjusted, create the database schema by running the following command (sqlite database will be automatically created):

    python3 manage.py migrate

This will take all the existing database migrations, run them and adjust the database schema. If you later on change models (remove fields, change fields or add fields) you need to run the following commands:

    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    python3 manage.py migrate

The first command will create the necessary migrations, the second one will apply the existing ones.

### Creating an Admin User
To create the initial admin user, run the following command:

    python3 manage.py createsuperuser

The commmand will ask for the necessary information.

### Loading Initial Data
To prepopulate the database with categories and other data run the following command:

    python3 manage.py loaddata nextcloudappstore/**/fixtures/*.json

### Starting the Server
Finally start the development server using the following command:

    python3 manage.py runserver

The website is available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000). Code changes will auto reload the server so happy developing!

**Note**: Do not use the development server in production! It is very slow and insecure.


## Deploying to Production
For production use you also need to create a **nextcloudappstore/local_settings.py** using something similar to this:

```python
DEBUG = False

# generate the SECRET_KEY by yourself for instance by using the following command:
# env LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc "a-zA-Z0-9-_\$\?" < /dev/urandom | head -c 64; echo
SECRET_KEY = 'change this!'

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['production-domain.com']

DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'admin@yourdomain.com'
ADMINS = [('Your Name', 'your-mail@example.com')]

# postgres or other db if needed if anything other than sqlite is used
# you need to create the database, user and password first
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        'USER': 'mydatabaseuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}

CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000
SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True

# Url for serving assets like CSS and images
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATIC_ROOT = '/var/www/production-domain.com/static/'

# Url for serving stuff uploaded by users
MEDIA_URL = 'https://separate-domain.com/upload/'
MEDIA_ROOT = '/var/www/example.com/upload/'

# Public and private keys for Googles recaptcha
RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY = '<YOUR PUBLIC KEY>'
RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY = '<YOUR PRIVATE KEY>'
```

For more information about web server setup, take a look at [the deployment documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/howto/deployment/)

TODO:
* check which server should be set up
* document pyvenv setup for webserver

## Keeping Up To Date
To fetch the latest changes from the repository run:

    git pull --rebase origin master

Aftewards adjust the database schema (if changed) by running the migrations:

    python3 manage.py migrate

and install any dependencies (if changed):

    pip3 install -r requirements/base.txt
    pip3 install -r requirements/development.txt

On production you will need to run the collectstatic command to copy updated assets into the target folders:

    python3 manage.py collectstatic
